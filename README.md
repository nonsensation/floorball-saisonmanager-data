# Cached JSON-Data from [Saisonmanager.de](https://saisonmanager.de)

To not query the SM-API for every page visit, I have mirrored the JSON files in `data` - the routes remain the same.

This can be used for content, that is not currently live updated or ongoing like previous match reports or the league structure itself.


There will be updated instructions on how to switch between live API calls and the static version in the future, see [floorball-saisonmanager](https://github.com/nonsensation/floorball-saisonmanager).
